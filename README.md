# machine-learning
cifar dataset is taken as the dataset which has 10 class
they are split into train,test,validation datasets 
model is created using keras which has 3 cov2d and maxpooling layers which is replicated for 3 layers
it is trained with train data with 10 epochs which on the run is tested with validation dataset
finally,it is tested with test dataset and the accuracy and loss is printed
